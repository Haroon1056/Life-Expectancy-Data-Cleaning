# Life Expectancy Data Cleaning for Machine Learning

This project focuses on cleaning life expectancy data for machine learning models. The dataset contains various attributes related to the life expectancy of different countries, and the cleaning process is essential for improving the performance of machine learning models.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Life Expectancy dataset
- **Objective**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  - Seaborn (for correlation analysis)

## Features

- Handling missing values
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw life expectancy dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for cleaning and analysis.
- `cleaned_data/`: Processed and cleaned data after performing all transformations.
- `visualizations/`: Visualizations and plots created during the EDA process.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
